Releases for Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) targeting 5.14-OEM kernel.

# Tested configurations
5.14-OEM kernel:
    Repository: git://git.launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-oem/+git/focal
    Branch:     origin/oem-5.14-next
    Commit:     e7a3b771077f

# Prerequisites
Ensure that 5.14-OEM headers are installed or are available.
If you've already installed the 5.14-OEM kernel and headers,
you can omit the KLIB and KLIB_BUILD environment variables from the build step.
In the example, I'm working with a 5.14-OEM kernel located and built in `../focal`

# Building
$ make -j`nproc` KLIB=../focal KLIB_BUILD=../focal defconfig-i915
$ make -j`nproc` KLIB=../focal KLIB_BUILD=../focal

There are a couple warnings that are expected, but the build should complete.

# Installing
$ make KLIB=../focal KLIB_BUILD=../focal install

# Creating a Debian DKMS package
$ dpkg-buildpackage
$ dh clean

The DKMS package will be created in `../`.


# NOTES
Currently i915 'selfetsts' are non functional. If you enable them (using the defconfig 'deconfig-i915_selftest')
you will encounter a compilation warning elevated to an error (-Wall). To fix this, disable 'selftest' for i915.

As mentioned earlier, 2 warnings are expected during compilation.
